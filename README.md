# Notes

As you probably know I haven't touched Angular 1.x for nearly a year.  I went with 1.5 component-based solution as it allowed me to think about the architecture of the app in a React-like way.  I decided on the NG6-Starter boilerplate project as it gave me ES6 and components.  However, it was probably too complex for my requirements.  It would have been better for me to build out my own project for this task.

Testing was a bit of an issue for me and it hasn't been completed.  I ran into issues with gaining access to the various bits of code - particularly mocking services and also had issues with the testing frameworks.

As for improvements - I would have done a little more work on the UI and would have retooled the project to make it a little less complex.
